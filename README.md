# Vue Typescript Dashboard

## Overview

A minimal vue typescript admin sample dashboard with element-ui & axios & svgicon & permission control & lint, part of the code was generated by [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) and [jarvis](https://github.com/Armour/Jarvis).

I've chosen ElementUI because of it's predictability, support and ease of use for large applications.
Typescript is great to reduce number of errors and bugs further on. And for big apps support.
